## StarHue

**StarHue** is a very simple color-picking tool that allows you to copy any color on your screen. It provides color codes in RGB and HEX formats.

**Supports**: Windows 10 and Windows 11 64-bit (x64) operating systems.

**Developed and designed by** [@justinnas](https://github.com/justinnas)

<br>

## **Download**

You can download the latest version of StarHue from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/justinnas/StarHue-Color-Picker/releases/). Scroll down to 'Assets' section and choose between the installer or the portable version based on your preference.

After downloading the application, double-click the .exe file to begin installation.<br/><br/>
In some cases, you may see a "Windows protected your PC" warning. This appears because the application is new and not yet recognized by Microsoft. To proceed: Click "More info" and then click "Run anyway".
<br/><br/>Once past the warning, follow the on-screen instructions in the setup wizard to complete the installation.
